{# Restaurant-Dashboard
Develop a responsive and interactive dashboard for university residence staff using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a chosen framework (Bootstrap or Tailwind). The dashboard should provide functionalities like:
Data Visualization: Utilize charts and graphs (e.g., bar charts, pie charts) to represent residence data like occupancy rates, room types, and maintenance requests. Consider libraries like Chart.js or D3.js.
Room Management: Display a list of rooms with details like resident information, room status (occupied, vacant, under maintenance), and basic amenities. Allow filtering and sorting options.
Maintenance Requests: Provide a section to view and manage maintenance requests submitted by residents. Include functionalities like filtering by room, status (pending, ongoing, completed), and adding notes.
Alerts and Notifications: Display important alerts and notifications for staff, such as upcoming room inspections, maintenance deadlines, or urgent resident requests.
Theme Switcher: Implement a feature that allows staff to switch between different themes (light/dark or custom colors) using browser storage (cookies or local storage).
Technical Considerations:

HTML: Leverage Semantic HTML for improved accessibility and SEO.
CSS:
Utilize CSS Grid for a well-organized and responsive layout.
Integrate a CSS framework like Bootstrap to streamline development and provide pre-built components.
Employ SASS for efficient and maintainable CSS code with mixins, functions, variables, and partials.
JavaScript/jQuery:
Implement interactive elements using advanced JavaScript features like object-oriented programming and ES6 syntax.
Utilize jQuery for DOM manipulation and Ajax requests to fetch data from a mock API simulating the residence management system's backend.
Charting Libraries: Choose a suitable library like Chart.js or D3.js to create visualizations for residence data.
Project Deliverables:

Functional Dashboard: A fully responsive and interactive dashboard showcasing the outlined functionalities.
Clean and Commented Code: Well-structured and documented codebase using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and chosen libraries.
Mock API Integration (Optional): A basic mock API (local JSON file) to simulate data retrieval.
Project Documentation: A brief document outlining the project setup, technical choices, usage instructions, and any external libraries used.
